# Writing assignments

See the syllabus and "writing tips" document for guidance on how to prepare
these reports.

All assignments are due at midnight (11:59pm) on the date stated below.

* (September 19th) Write a memo documenting a specific research question
that can be addressed using the BHHT (Brief History of Human Time) data,
the methods that you use to address this question, and your findings.
Your question and approach should align with the material presented in the
course lecture, focusing either on the lifespans or representation of people based
on their reported characteristics.  For this first assignment, you can
borrow generously from the findings and code discussed in class, but please
aim to report at least one novel finding.

* (October 3rd) Write a memo documenting a specific research question
that can be addressed using the US natality data.  Your question should
build on the class discussions focusing on demographic characteristics
associated with higher or lower birth counts in a county.  You should
primarily make use of Poisson regression and factor methods as discussed
in class, but your analysis should address a question that is considerably
deeper than we had time to develop.
