# Capstone Seminar in Statistics

## Instructor

Kerby Shedden (kshedden@umich.edu)

## GSIs

* Alexander Kagan (amkagan@umich.edu)

* Elishua Shumpert (elishuas@umich.edu)

## Overview

This is both an applied statistics and a technical communications course,
and is intended for advanced undergraduate majors in Statistics who have
already completed core courses in probability, theoretical statistics, and
applied statistics (425, 426, 413 or equivalent).  This course satisfies
the LSA Upper-level writing requirement (ULWR).

The goals of the course are as follows:

* Provide experience conducting data analyses through case studies
  drawn from multiple domains.

* Provide multiple opportunities to write about statistical findings
  and receive feedback.  Some assignments will be revised and re-evaluated.

* Provide exposure to new statistical methods and theoretical
  concepts.

* Provide hands-on experience working with data and implementing
  analyses.

## Format:

The lectures will be balanced between informal discussion and more formal
lectures delivered by the instructor to introduce new areas and unfamiliar
ideas.  Regular attendance and participation is expected.  This is an
in-person seminar-style course and lectures will not be recorded or streamed.
The instructor and GSIs will hold office hours but there is no recitation
or lab.

## Course materials

All course materials will be available through the course canvas site, with
most code to be found on [here](github.com/kshedden/UMStats504) and written
materials to be found [here](kshedden.github.io/UMStats504).  There is no
textbook for this course.

## Coursework

The coursework will entirely take the form of individual writing
assignments. There will be approximately 8 writing assignments, one for each
case study. Three of these assignements will be revised and resubmitted,
so there will be approximately 11 graded writing submissions during the
semester. Each writing assignment will be 2-3 pages in length and will take
the form of a memo prepared by a professional data analyst, summarizing
methods and findings from a data analysis. One or two of the assignments
may focus on design and planning of a study, or provide a methods review,
rather than analysis of a dataset.

Each writing assignment will address a writing prompt provided by the
instructor.  You will have significant latitude in your approach, but the
analyses are not completely open-ended -- you should focus on addressing the
issues raised in the writing prompt and in most cases you will be asked to
use a specific approach in your analysis.

Writing for this course is relatively short and focused.  The text component
of a report should generally be 2-3 pages in length, with 3 pages being a
hard limit.  You may provide a limited number of graphs and tables that do
not count toward the page limit, but only include graphs and tables that
directly contribute to your main claims.

There are no exams in this course.

## Using Google docs

Writing assignments will be submitted using Google Docs. Please use your
University of Michigan user account when creating these files, and use default
fonts and margins.  To facilitate grading, you must title each document
in the form “uniqname stats 485 assignment X”, where “uniqname” is
your UM login id and X=1, 2, ... is the assignment number.  For revisions,
create a copy of the document and name it in the form "uniqname stats 485
assignment X.R".  Share all your assignments with the instructor and both GSIs
(but please do not send us an email notification when you share the document).
You should not edit any assignment after the due date, note that all edits
are tracked in Google Docs. Instructors will provide feedback directly on
your Google Doc.

## Case studies and datasets

The case studies will represent a variety of areas of inquiry in domains
including human health, social and behavioral science, natural science, and
industry/commerce. We will spend approximately three lectures discussing
the background and relevant statistical issues associated with each case
study. After this context is provided, you will be given a writing prompt and
will have approximately 10 days two prepare your report.  Since you  will
have advanced notice and 10 days to complete each assignment, extensions
will be given only in extreme situations.

## Computing

Students should be competent in data manipulation and data analysis based on
skills learned in previous courses. In some cases model code will be provided,
but students are expected to be resourceful in terms of data manipulation,
writing and debugging code, and implementing algorithms. Code is not submitted
or graded and you are free to use any computing environment and software
that you like. Model code will be provided in R, Python, and/or Julia.

Many of the datasets used in this course will be large.  In addition
to statistical analyses, substantial data manipulations will
be required.  If you are using R, you will likely want to use the
[data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html)
or [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) libraries.  If you are using Python,
you will likely want to use the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) library.
However these are only suggestions and you are free to use whatever software
and libraries you choose.

Some of the code used to produce the analyses discussed in the
course lectures will be available on the course Github site
[here](http://github.com/kshedden/UMStats504).

## Collaboration and academic honesty

A report written for this class should primarily reflect your own
independently-developed ideas.  Each student must complete their own analysis
and writing, but you may discuss analysis strategies and coding issuses with
other students at a high level. Each student should develop and maintain
their own code to conduct the analysis in each project.

In the submitted writings, plagiarism from other students or from any
non-acknowledged source is a serious violation of academic integrity and
will result at minimum in a zero score on the assignment, and may also be
referred to the LSA Honor Council.

## Grading

Your course grade will be an unweighted average of scores received on all
submitted assignments. Each assignment will be scored on content (50 points)
and communication (50 points), according to the following rubric:

* Content (50 points)

    * [10 pts] Does the report have an informative title?

    * [10 pts] Does the analysis provide insight related to the question at hand?

    * [10 pts] Is the analytic approach appropriate, are strengths and limitations of
    the approach adequately discussed?

    * [10 pts] Are the conclusions stated explicitly and supported by the analysis and
    reported results?

    * [10 pts] Does the report include one informative graph?

* Communication (50 points)

    * [10 pts] Is the analysis goal clearly and explicitly stated and motivated?

    * [10 pts] Are analysis methods adequately documented?

    * [10 pts] Are the findings and conclusions precisely stated and interpreted?

    * [10 pts] Is statistical terminology used appropriately and defined where appropriate?

    * [10 pts] Is the writing well-organized, straightforward to read, and accessible to
    the intended audience?


## Some major themes of this course are:

* Formulating meaningful and tractable questions based on
  research goals and consistent with available data

* Devising, documenting, and implementing analysis strategies

* Communicating findings

* Leveraging knowledge of statistical foundations and theory when
  engaging in applied research

* Understanding the capabilities and limitations of statistical
  methods

* Understanding the value and limitations of different types of data

* Interpretation of analytic results

* Developing data manipulation and computing skills, especially for
  large and complex data sets

* Building knowledge about several applied research areas where
  data-driven investigation plays a major role

All writing is to be done individually, and should primarily reflect
each student's own ideas.  Students are welcome and encouraged to discuss
statistical methods, coding strategies, and topics relating to the data and
motivating questions for each assignment.

## Expectations for student writing

This is both an applied statistics course and a technical communications
course.  The coursework will consist of writing and data analysis.  Only the
writing will be graded (you will not submit any code for evaluation).
All statisticians must frequently communicate and document their findings
in written form.  Writing about your analytic plans and research findings,
and writing reviews and critiques of other people's findings are excellent
ways to organize your thoughts, strengthen your arguments, and identify
weaknesses in your claims.

For most of the writing assignments in this course, you should imagine that
you are writing a memo or email to be read by collaborators or colleagues.
Your "audience" consists of people familiar with the data and scientific
(or industrial) context behind the data, and who are also knowledgeable
about statistics at an undergraduate level or higher.

Below are some guidelines for writing in this course.  These are a few of
the most important things to keep in mind.  We will expand on this a lot
during the semester.

* Write in an appropriate academic or business tone.  Do not write
  informally or casually, but also avoid excessively formal language.

* Organize your content so that your writing has a focused message,
  with each paragraph contributing distinctly to communicating this message.

* Use simple, direct language.  Avoid convoluted expressions, hidden
  or needlessly subtle meanings, unusual vocabulary, and digressions that
  do not contribute to your main message.

* Express your arguments in as plain and simple terms as is practical.
  Do not write in a way that requires the reader to re-read your writing
  multiple times to understand your point.  Favor short sentences in the
  active voice with one clause, and paragraphs that focus on one topic and
  do not extend for more than half a page.

* Write for an audience that may include non-native English speakers.
  Avoid colloquialisms and obscure cultural references or metaphors.

* You are expected to be able to write in grammatically-correct
  English.  It is understood that there are many non-native English speakers
  in the course, and occasional minor grammatical issues will be overlooked.
