# Overview

This course is intended for advanced undergraduate Statistics majors
who have already completed foundation courses in probability,
theoretical statistics, and applied statistics.  The goals of the
course are to provide students with the following:

* Experience conducting data analyses through case studies drawn from multiple domains.

* Multiple opportunities to write about statistical findings and
receive feedback.  Some assignments will be revised and re-evaluated.

* Exposure to new statistical methods and theoretical concepts.

* Hands-on experience working with data and implementing analyses.

# Format:

The lecture time will be balanced between informal discussion,
discussion of student work, and more formal lectures delivered by the
instructor to introduce new areas and unfamiliar ideas.

# Coursework

The coursework will entirely take the form of individual writing
assignments. There will be approximately 8 writing assignments, one
for each case study. Three of these assignements will be revised and
resubmitted, so there will be approximately 11 graded writing
submissions during the semester. Each writing assignment will be 2-3
pages in length and will resemble a memo prepared by a professional
data analyst, summarizing methods and findings from a data
analysis. One or two of the assignments may focus on design and
planning of a study, or a methods review, rather than analysis of an
existing dataset.

Writing assignments will be submitted usingn Google Docs. To
facilitate grading, you must title each document in the form “uniqname
stats 485 assignment X”, where “uniqname” is your UM login id and X=1,
2, ... is the assignment number.  For revisions, create a copy of the
document and name it in the form "uniqname stats 485 assignment X.R".
Share all your assignments with the instructor and both GSI's (but do
not send an email notification when you share the document).  You
should not edit any assignment after the due date, note that all edits
are tracked in Google Docs. Instructors will provide feedback directly
on your Google Doc.

# Case studies and datasets

The case studies will represent a variety of areas of inquiry
including human health, social and behavioral science, and natural
science. We will spend approximately two weeks discussing the back-
ground and relevant statistical issues associated with each case
study. After this context is provided, you will be given a prompt and
will have approxi- mately 10 days two prepare your report.

# Computing

Students should have gained facility in data manipulation and analysis
in previous courses. Some model code will be provided, but students
are expected to be resourceful in terms of data manipulation, writing
and debugging code, and implementing algorithms. Code is not submitted
or graded and you are free to use any computing environment and
software that you like. Limited model code will be provided in R,
Python, and Julia.  Collaboration and academic honesty: Each student
must complete their own assignment, but you may discuss analysis
strategies and coding issuses with other students at a high
level. Plagiarism from other students or from any non-acknowledged
source is a serious violation of academic integrity and will result at
a minimum with a zero score on the assignment, and may also be
referred to the LSA Honor Council.

# Grading

Your course grade will be an unweighted average of all submit- ted
assignments. Each assignment will be scored on content (50 points) and
communication (50 points). The content assessment will be based
primar- ily on the appropriateness of the analysis, and whether the
conclusions are supported by the evidence provided in the report. The
communication score will focus on completeness (providing background,
motivation, documenting the analysis, stating clear conclusions, and
providing all relevant supporting results and evidence), as well as on
factors such as clarity, precision, and appropriate use of
terminology.





hands-on
experience using a variety of techniques from modern applied
statistics. Most course material is presented through case studies involving data drawn from various
fields.  Lectures will provide background about each case study along
with discussion of relevant methodologies.  Students will then conduct
independent data analyses and produce brief written
reports.  Evaluation will be based on attaining insight from the data,
effective communication of findings, and appropriate use of
statistical methodology, as shown in the written reports.

Participation in class discussions is an essential part of the class.
Regular attendance and active participation is expected from all
students.

Some major themes of this course are:

* Formulating meaningful and tractable questions based on
  research goals and consistent with available data

* Devising, documenting, and implementing analysis strategies

* Communicating findings

* Leveraging knowledge of statistical foundations and theory when
  engaging in applied research

* Understanding the capabilities and limitations of statistical
  methods

* Understanding the value and limitations of different types of data

* Interpretation of analytic results

* Developing data manipulation and computing skills, especially for
  large and complex data sets

* Building knowledge about several applied research areas where
  data-driven investigation plays a major role


## Pre-requisites

Students are expected to have mastered the essential foundations of
statistics at the undergraduate and master's levels, and should posess
a solid understanding of ideas
such as sampling, variation, bias, and uncertainty.  Students should
have substantial prior exposure to core statistical methods including
regression and multivariate analysis.

## Coursework

Students will conduct independent analyses of datasets
throughout the semester and write about their findings. Datasets, reading
materials, and writing prompts will be provided by the instructor.

There is no textbook or other materials to purchase for the course.

## Grading

Writing assignments will be due roughly every 7-10 days, and will be
submitted online using Google docs.

There are no exams for this class.

Writing assignments will generally be short (around 2 pages).  See
below for guidelines on what we are expecting in the writing assignments.

The instructors or GSI will read and evaluate every assignment,
providing individual feedback.  Assignments will be graded on a 100
point scale.

All assignments will count equally toward the final grade.  Since
assignments are submitted electronically and are announced at least 7
days in advance, late assignments will generally not be accepted.
Exceptions to this policy may be made at the instructor's discretion,
but only in cases of serious and unanticipated personal emergencies.

All writing is to be done individually, and should primarily reflect
each student's own ideas.  Students are welcome and encouraged to
discuss statistical methods, coding strategies, and topics relating to
the data and motivating questions
for each assignment.

Plagiarism, including copying any material prepared by another person,
copying from other students (with or without permission), or
allowing other students to write all or part of your assignment, will be handled
strictly following U-M policies regarding academic integrity.

## Computing

You are free to use whatever computing tools you choose.  Code will
not be submitted or evaluated in this course.  The instructors will
mainly use R or Python when providing code for illustration.

Most of the datasets used in this course will be large.  In addition
to statistical analyses, substantial data manipulations will be
required.  If you are using R, you will likely want to use the
[data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html)
or [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) libraries.  If you are using
Python, you will likely want to use the
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) library.  However these are only
suggestions and you are free to use whatever software and libraries you
choose.

The code used to produce the analyses discussed in the course lectures
will be available on the course Github site
[here](http://github.com/kshedden/UMStats504).

## Expectations for student writing

This is both an applied statistics course and a technical communications
course.  The coursework will consist of writing and data analysis.  Only
the writing will be graded (you will not submit any code for evaluation).  All
statisticians must frequently communicate and document their findings
in written form.  Writing about your analytic plans and research
findings, and writing reviews and critiques of other people's writing are all
excellent ways to organize your thoughts, strengthen your arguments,
and identify weaknesses in your claims.

For most of the writing assignments in this course, you should imagine
that you are writing a memo or email to be read by collaborators or
colleagues.  Your "audience" consists of people familiar with the data
and scientific (or industrial) context behind the data, and who are
also knowledgeable about statistics.

Below are some guidelines for writing in this course.  These are a
few of the most important things to keep in mind.  We will expand
on this a lot during the semester.

* Write in an appropriate academic or business tone.  Do not write
  informally or casually, but also avoid excessively formal language.

* Organize your content so that your writing has a focused message,
  with each paragraph contributing distinctly to communicating this
  message.

* Use simple, direct language.  Avoid convoluted expressions, hidden
  or needlessly subtle meanings, unusual vocabulary, and digressions
  that do not contribute to your main message.

* Express your arguments in as plain and simple terms as is practical.
  Do not write in a
  way that requires the reader to re-read your writing multiple times
  to understand your point.  Favor short sentences in the active voice
  with one clause, and paragraphs that focus on one topic and do not
  extend for more than half a page.

* Write for an audience that may include non-native English speakers.
  Avoid colloquialisms and obscure cultural references.

* You are expected to be able to write in grammatically-correct
  English, appropriate for graduate level coursework.  It is
  understood that there are many non-native English speakers in the
  course, and occasional minor grammatical issues will be overlooked.
